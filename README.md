# BudgetManager

This budget manager allows you to record all your income and expenses! Begin by selecting the dropdown which shows if you received money or spent money. Afterwards, add a description, input a value, and hit enter once you're finished. It will then record the money onto the respective subsection listed "income" or "expense."

This budget manager also shows the percentage amount of each expense is relative to the total amount of income you received.
